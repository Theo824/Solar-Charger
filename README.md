Designed and built a solar panel-powered constant current charger for NiMH batteries and an iPhone, 
with the batteries functioning as a power bank or used in other devices.

Sketched the design concept, with transistors acting as current sources and buck converters regulating PV voltage. 
Researched the iPhone charging handshake protocol, modified the circuit in NI Multisim to correct functionality, and integrated it onto a 2-layer PCB using KiCad.

The charger delivered 5 W to the iPhone and approximately 4 W to five AA NiMH batteries in series. 
Once fully charged, the auto-cutoff reduced the charging current by 58.33% to below 0.1C. I
n theory, the batteries could also charge an iPhone 12 Pro Max up to three times without the solar panels.
